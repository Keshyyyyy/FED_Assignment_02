# FED_Assignment_02
Collaborative space for assignment 2 between Keshwindren Gandipanh and Pey Zhi Xun.

Name of the app: BrainWave

Design process is stated below
Idea/theme:
We decided to go with the idea of creating a simple trivia game which tests the users on their general knowledge in a more fun and enjoyable manner.

Target audience: 
Our game app is open for users of all ages to try and have fun with however, more emphasis is being put on the younger audience as we have identified them to being the most dominant potential user of our app.

Reason behind choosing this theme/idea:
  Our trivia game was inspired by an event that happened not so long during Ngee Ann Polytechnicâ€™s open house. In one of the SIG booths nearby the ICT block, the SIG OverFlow had introduced a fun little game to the visitors and the game was to choose a topic and answer questions based on those topics and it will then be evaluated and your score will be given in the end. We thought this game was something that would engage very well with the users as it did with us in real life. 
  Other than that, we also took inspiration from the game that was once on the world renowned platform Netflix under the name of Trivia Verse. This game tested the users on their general knowledge with gamifications that made it so much more enjoyable and fun to play and we decided to give this idea a go.

-A quiz option in which the trivia game will take place
-A sign in page for users to sign into in order to save their details for the app

Technologies used:
-Standard HTML
-Potential bootstrap implementations
-Basic javascript in order to add interesting affects
-Lottie animations to increase interactivity and potentially increase engagement for the app
-Standard CSS
-An API in order to retrieve the trivia questions from
